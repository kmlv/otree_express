working on otree 2.0.37 and python 3.6.4
when inside the repo: 
to start virtualenv
remove folder env if it exists
enter commands:
	virtualenv env
	source env/bin/activate
	pip3 install -r newreqs.txt

to deactivate, enter command "deactivate"
if pip3 doesnt work use pip, but experiment needs to run on python 3 (3.6 preferably, i dont 
think that 3.7 works)
