    <h4> General Instructions </h4>

    <p> Welcome to the LEEPS Laboratory. During the course of this session, you will be asked to make a series of decisions. By participating in this study, you will earn real money that will be paid to you in cash at the end of the experiment. On top of what you earn during the session, you will receive a participation fee of {{ player.participation_fee }}.</p>

<p> It is important you do not speak out loud, laugh or talk to other participants during the duration of the session. The use of cellphones or tablets is not allowed in this session. We expect and appreciate your cooperation. If you have any question, please raise your hand and an experimenter will attend to you. After you have read these instructions, you will answer a few brief questions to ensure you understand them.</p><br/>

<h4>Stages</h4>

<p>This session consists of a single round of interaction with two stages. In Stage 1, called <em>Task Stage</em>, you will work on a set of tasks to earn money. We will refer to the earned amount as the <em>task income</em>. Specific instructions for these tasks will be provided once Stage 1 starts.</p>

{####################################################################}
{#  Stage 2: general | All but TP #}
{% if group.treatment != 'TP' and group.treatment != 'TP-R' %}

    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, you will interact with another participant in the room. First, you will be anonymously paired with one another. This matching is random and, most likely, you will <b>not</b> be matched with the person sitting next to you. You will then be randomly assigned to be either of <strong><em>Role A</em></strong> or of <strong><em>Role B</em></strong>. Each pair will consists of one person in <em>Role A</em> and one person in <em>Role B</em>. You will be informed about your role on your computer screen as soon as Stage 2 starts. Since this is a one-time interaction, that will be the only role you will participate under. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment. </p> </br>

    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment. Once you make your decision, it cannot be changed. The image below shows the screen where you will make your decision: </p> </br>

        </div> </br>

    <h4> Role B:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role B</em>, you will first be asked to guess what percentage of your <em>task income</em> A will transfer to his/her own account.</p>

{% endif %}



{#    Stage 2: general | only TP #}
{% if group.treatment  == 'TP' or group.treatment == 'TP-R' %}

    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, there are three possible roles for each participant, <em>Role A</em>, <em>Role B</em> and <em>Role R</em>. First, one participant will be randomly assigned <em>Role R</em>. The rest of participants will be anonymously paired in groups of two. Within each group, roles will be randomly assigned so that there will be one person in <em>Role A</em> and one in <em>Role B</em>. This matching is random and, most likely, you will <b>not</b> be matched with the person sitting next to you. You will be informed about your role on your computer screen once Stage 2 starts. Since this is a one-time interaction, that will be the only role you will participate under. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment.</p>

    <h4> Role R: </h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role R</em> (Reader) your only task is to read the messages written by participants in <em>Role B</em> who are able to send a message to you. The Reader is the only participant that is going to read these messages. None of the other participants in today's session will ever read them. The Reader will not receive any information about participants of Roles A or B. After reading the messages, the Reader will confirm having read them.</p>

    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment. Once you make your decision, it cannot be changed. The image below shows the screen where you will make your decision: </p> </br>

    <h4> Role B:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role B</em>, you will first be asked to guess what percentage of your <em>task income</em> the participant in <em>Role A</em> will transfer to his/her own account.</p>
      {# Role B must continue in #}

{% endif %}

{#  Free message end #}
{% if group.treatment == 'FM' %}
    <p> You will then be informed about the amount that has been taken from your account by the participant in <em>Role A</em> that you are matched with. You will get the opportunity to write and send a message to him/her. This is a one-way, one-time message, and <em>Role A</em> will not have the chance to reply or change his/her decision.</p> </br>

        <p> After you submit your <em>valuation</em>, you will be informed about the <em>actual price</em> of sending your message. The <em>actual price</em> is randomly generated by the computer, and all numbers between {% if not points %}${%endif%}0 {% if points %}points{% endif %} and {{ group.BDM_uplimit }} are equally likely.</p>

If instead your <em>valuation</em> is lower than the <em>actual price</em>, then you do not get to deliver your message, and you will not be charged.</p>
        <p> Notice that, since your message is delivered only when your <em>valuation</em> exceeds the <em>actual price</em>, you will never pay for sending your message a price higher than your stated <em>valuation</em>.

That is, your message will be delivered only if you had chosen 'send message' over receiving the corresponding amount.
