    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, you will interact with another participant in the room. First, you will be anonymously paired with one another. This matching is random and, most likely, you will <b>not</b> be matched with the person sitting next to you. You will then be randomly assigned to be either of <strong><em>Role A</em></strong> or of <strong><em>Role B</em></strong>. Each pair will consists of one person in <em>Role A</em> and one person in <em>Role B</em>, and roles remain in the same role throughout the entire duration of the experiment. You will be informed about your role on your computer screen as soon as Stage 2 starts. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment. </p> </br>

    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment. Once you make your decision, it cannot be changed. The image below shows the screen where you will make your decision: </p> </br>

    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, there are three possible roles for each participant, <em>Role A</em>, <em>Role B</em> and <em>Role R</em>. First, one participant will be randomly assigned <em>Role R</em>. The rest of participants will be anonymously paired in groups of two. Within each group, roles will be randomly assigned so that there will be one person in <em>Role A</em> and one in <em>Role B</em>. This matching is random and, most likely, you will <b>not</b> be matched with the person sitting next to you.

    <h4> Role R: </h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role R</em> (Reader) your only task is to read the messages written by participants in <em>Role B</em> who are able to send a message to you. The Reader is the only participant that is going to read these messages. None of the other participants in today's session will ever read them. The Reader will not receive any information about participants of Roles A or B. After reading the messages, the Reader will confirm having read them.</p>
