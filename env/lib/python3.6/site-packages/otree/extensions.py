"""
(THIS IS CURRENTLY PRIVATE API, MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE)

To create an oTree extension, add a package called ``otree_extensions``
to your app, and add the app name in settings.py to EXTENSION_APPS. 
It can contain any of the following submodules:

urls.py
-------

should contain a variable ``urlpatterns``, which will be appended to
oTree's built-in URL patterns.

routing.py
----------

Should contain a variable ``channel_routing``,
with a list of channel routes, as described in the Django channels documentation:

https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html#routing

These routes will be appended to oTree's built-in channel routes.

admin.py
--------

This module allows you to define custom data exports that will be included
in oTree's data export page. Define a variable ``data_export_views``,
which is a list of Django class-based views (see Django docs).

Each view should define a ``get()`` method with the following signature::

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):

This method should return an HTTP response with
the exported data (e.g. CSV, XLSX, JSON, etc), using the appropriate MIME type
on the HTTP response.

Each view must also have the following attributes:

-   ``url_pattern``: the URL pattern string, e.g. '^mychat_export/$'
-   ``url_name``: see Django docs on reverse resolution of URLs, e.g. 'mychat_export'
-   ``display_name``: The text of the download hyperlink on the data export page
    (e.g. "Chat Data Export")

You don't need to worry about login_required and AUTH_LEVEL;
oTree will handle this automatically.

(In the future, admin.py may be used for other admin customizations,
not just data export.)
