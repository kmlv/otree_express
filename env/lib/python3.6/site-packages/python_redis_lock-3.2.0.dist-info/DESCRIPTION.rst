Overview
========



Lock context manager implemented via redis SETNX/BLPOP.

* Free software: BSD license

Interface targeted to be exactly like `threading.Lock <http://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#threading.Lock>`_.

Usage
=====

Because we don't want to require users to share the lock instance across processes you will have to give them names.
Eg::

    conn = StrictRedis()
    with redis_lock.Lock(conn, "name-of-the-lock"):
        print("Got the lock. Doing some work ...")
        time.sleep(5)

Eg::

    lock = redis_lock.Lock(conn, "name-of-the-lock")
    if lock.acquire(blocking=False):
        print("Got the lock.")
    else:
        print("Someone else has the lock.")


You can also associate an identifier along with the lock so that it can be retrieved later by the same process, or by a
different one. This is useful in cases where the application needs to identify the lock owner (find out who currently
owns the lock). Eg::

    import socket
    host_id = "owned-by-%s" % socket.gethostname()
    lock = redis_lock.Lock(conn, "name-of-the-lock", id=host_id)
    if lock.acquire(blocking=False):
        print("Got the lock.")
    else:
        if lock.get_owner_id() == host_id:
            print("I already acquired this in another process.")
        else:
            print("The lock is held on another machine.")


Avoid dogpile effect in django
------------------------------

The dogpile is also known as the thundering herd effect or cache stampede. Here's a pattern to avoid the problem
without serving stale data. The work will be performed a single time and every client will wait for the fresh data.

To use this you will need `django-redis <https://github.com/niwibe/django-redis>`_, however, ``python-redis-lock``
provides you a cache backend that has a cache method for your convenience. Just install ``python-redis-lock`` like
this::

    pip install "python-redis-lock[django]"

Now put something like this in your settings::

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'redis_lock.django_cache.RedisCache',
            'LOCATION': 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'CLIENT_CLASS': 'django_redis.client.DefaultClient'
            }
        }
    }


.. note::


    If using a `django-redis` < `3.8.x`, you'll probably need `redis_cache` 
    which has been deprecated in favor to `django_redis`. The `redis_cache` 
    module is removed in `django-redis` versions > `3.9.x`. See `django-redis notes <http://niwinz.github.io/django-redis/latest/#_configure_as_cache_backend>`_.


This backend just adds a convenient ``.lock(name, expire=None)`` function to django-redis's cache backend.

You would write your functions like this::

    from django.core.cache import cache

    def function():
        val = cache.get(key)
        if val:
            return val
        else:
            with cache.lock(key):
                val = cache.get(key)
                if val:
                    return val
                else:
                    # DO EXPENSIVE WORK
                    val = ...

                    cache.set(key, value)
                    return val


Troubleshooting
---------------

In some cases, the lock remains in redis forever (like a server blackout / redis or application crash / an unhandled
exception). In such cases, the lock is not removed by restarting the application. One solution is to turn on the
`auto_renewal` parameter in combination with `expire` to set a time-out on the lock, but let `Lock()` automatically
keep resetting the expire time while your application code is executing::

    # Get a lock with a 60-second lifetime but keep renewing it automatically
    # to ensure the lock is held for as long as the Python process is running.
    with redis_lock.Lock('my-lock', expire=60, auto_renewal=True):
        # Do work....

Another solution is to use the ``reset_all()`` function when the application starts::

    # On application start/restart
    import redis_lock
    redis_lock.reset_all()

Alternativelly, you can reset individual locks via the ``reset`` method.

Use these carefully, if you understand what you do.


Features
========

* based on the standard SETNX recipe
* optional expiry
* optional timeout
* optional lock renewal (use a low expire but keep the lock active)
* no spinloops at acquire

Implementation
==============

``redis_lock`` will use 2 keys for each lock named ``<name>``:

* ``lock:<name>`` - a string value for the actual lock
* ``lock-signal:<name>`` - a list value for signaling the waiters when the lock is released

This is how it works:

Changelog
=========

3.2.0 (2016-10-29)
------------------

* Changed the signal key cleanup operation do be done without any expires. This prevents lingering keys around for some time.
  Contributed by Andrew Pashkin in `#38 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/38>`_.
* Allow locks with given `id` to acquire. Previously it assumed that if you specify the `id` then the lock was already
  acquired. See `#44 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/issues/44>`_ and
  `#39 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/issues/39>`_.
* Allow using other redis clients with a ``strict=False``. Normally you're expected to pass in an instance
  of ``redis.StrictRedis``.
* Added convenience method `locked_get_or_set` to Django cache backend.

3.1.0 (2016-04-16)
------------------

* Changed the auto renewal to automatically stop the renewal thread if lock gets garbage collected. Contributed by
  Andrew Pashkin in `#33 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/33>`_.

3.0.0 (2016-01-16)
------------------

* Changed ``release`` so that it expires signal-keys immediately. Contributed by Andrew Pashkin in `#28
  <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/28>`_.
* Resetting locks (``reset`` or ``reset_all``) will release the lock. If there's someone waiting on the reset lock now it will
  acquire it. Contributed by Andrew Pashkin in `#29 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/29>`_.
* Added the ``extend`` method on ``Lock`` objects. Contributed by Andrew Pashkin in `#24
  <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/24>`_.
* Documentation improvements on ``release`` method. Contributed by Andrew Pashkin in `#22
  <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/22>`_.
* Fixed ``acquire(block=True)`` handling when ``expire`` option was used (it wasn't blocking indefinitely). Contributed by
  Tero Vuotila in `#35 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/35>`_.
* Changed ``release`` to check if lock was acquired with he same id. If not, ``NotAcquired`` will be raised.
  Previously there was just a check if it was acquired with the same instance (self._held).
  **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE**
* Removed the ``force`` option from ``release`` - it wasn't really necessary and it only encourages sloppy programming. See
  `#25 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/issues/25>`_.
  **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE**
* Dropped tests for Python 2.6. It may work but it is unsupported.

2.3.0 (2015-09-27)
------------------

* Added the ``timeout`` option. Contributed by Victor Torres in `#20 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/20>`_.

2.2.0 (2015-08-19)
------------------

* Added the ``auto_renewal`` option. Contributed by Nick Groenen in `#18 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/18>`_.

2.1.0 (2015-03-12)
------------------

* New specific exception classes: ``AlreadyAcquired`` and ``NotAcquired``.
* Slightly improved efficiency when non-waiting acquires are used.

2.0.0 (2014-12-29)
------------------

* Rename ``Lock.token`` to ``Lock.id``. Now only allowed to be set via constructor. Contributed by Jardel Weyrich in `#11 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/11>`_.

1.0.0 (2014-12-23)
------------------

* Fix Django integration. (reported by Jardel Weyrich)
* Reorganize tests to use py.test.
* Add test for Django integration.
* Add ``reset_all`` functionality. Contributed by Yokotoka in `#7 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-redis-lock/pull/7>`_.
