Description: Django's generic class based view implementation is unneccesarily complicated.
        
        Django vanilla views gives you all the same functionality, in a vastly simplified, easier-to-use package, including:
        
        * No mixin classes.
        * No calls to super().
        * A sane class heirarchy.
        * A stripped down API.
        * Simpler method implementations, with less magical behavior.
        
        Remember, even though the API has been greatly simplified, everything you're able to do with Django's existing implementation is also supported in django-vanilla-views.
