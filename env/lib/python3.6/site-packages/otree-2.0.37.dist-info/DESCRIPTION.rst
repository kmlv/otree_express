These are the core oTree libraries.

Before you fork this project, keep in mind that otree-core is updated
frequently, and over time you might get upstream merge conflicts, as
your local project diverges from the oTree mainline version.

Instead, consider creating a project with ``otree startproject`` and
making your modifications in an app, using oTreeâ€™s public API. You can
create custom URLs, channels, override settings, etc.

----------

Typical setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install --upgrade otree
    otree startproject oTree
    otree resetdb
    otree runserver

Core dev setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are modifying otree-core locally, clone or download this repo,
then run this from the project root:

::

    pip install -e .
    cd .. # or wherever you will start your project
    otree startproject oTree
    otree resetdb
    otree runserver

See `this`_ document that explains how oTree differs from a typical
Django project.
