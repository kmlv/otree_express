    <p>This session consists of a single round of interaction with two stages. In Stage 1, called <em>Task Stage</em>, you will work on a set of tasks to earn money. We will refer to the earned amount as the <em>task income</em>. Specific instructions for these tasks will be provided once Stage 1 starts.</p>
    {####################################################################}
    {# Stage 2: general | All but TP #}
    {% if group.treatment != 'TP' %}
    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, you will interact with another participant in the room. First, you will be anonymously paired with one another. This matching is random and, most likely, you will <b>not</b> be matched with the person sitting next to you. You will then be randomly assigned to be either of <strong><em>Role A</em></strong> or of <strong><em>Role B</em></strong>. Each pair will consists of one person in <em>Role A</em> and one person in <em>Role B</em>. You will be informed about your role on your computer screen as soon as Stage 2 starts. Since this is a one-time interaction, that will be the only role you will participate under. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment. </p> </br>
    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of <em>Role B</em>’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment. Once you make your decision, it cannot be changed. </p> </br>

First, one participant will be randomly assigned <em>Role R</em>. The rest of participants will be anonymously paired in groups of two. Within each group, roles will be randomly assigned so that there will be one person in <em>Role A</em> and one in <em>Role B</em>.
